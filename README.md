# financial-management-system
A tool I'll be developing to keep track of my finances this summer. 

I found that I get disorganized when I try to manage my spending without any kind of analysis so I figured I would create
a platform that would provide an organized approach to this. In part inspired by the script I wrote to calculate my grade for 
my data structures course (CS61B) in Spring 2017.
